###Project Setup
To set up a react-native project, you can make use of the React Native CLI or the Expo CLI.

- I would be making use of the Expo CLI to set up a react-native project. To do so, run the following command on your terminal.

      npm install -g expo-cli
The above command would install Expo CLI on your machine.

Note: You need to have Node v12 installed on your machine to be able to install Expo CLI using the command line.

- After the above command runs successfully, run the command below to generate/create a react-native project.

        expo init project-name


Once the above command runs successfully, open the project in your desired code editor, and run npm start on the terminal to start the application.
